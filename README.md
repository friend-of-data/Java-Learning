This README file is my learning notes/ logs for learning Java language
## 1. Package, class, and methods
In Java, the building block of a program is the class. A class serves as a container for methods, which define the behavior of the class. Methods in Java are functions that belong to a class. Multiple related classes can be grouped into a package to organize and modularize the code.

There is certain naming convention in Java. Packages are normally named in lower case, classes PascalCase case and methods lowerCamelCase.

VisualStudio can be used to edit Java code. After running/ compiling, the package will be a higher hierarchy, under which there will be .Java and .Class file.
## 2. Public modifier
In java, public is a access modifier that defines the accessibility of something (class, methods, variables).

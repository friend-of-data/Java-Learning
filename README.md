This README file is my learning notes/ logs for learning Java language
## 1. Package, class, and methods
In Java, the building block of a program is the class. A class serves as a container for methods, which define the behavior of the class. Methods in Java are functions that belong to a class. Multiple related classes can be grouped into a package to organize and modularize the code.
There is certain naming convention in Java. Packages are normally named in lower case, classes PascalCase case and methods lowerCamelCase.
